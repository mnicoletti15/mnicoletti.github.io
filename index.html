          <h4>Context and Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Every student knows how hard it is to find housing in Berkeley. More generally, anyone living or working in the Bay Area knows how rents are, in general, extremely expensive. The housing crisis is not new to the Bay Area—in fact it has existed since the 1970s, and has only worsened since then. A lack of space, strict zoning laws, and staunch opposition from neighborhood homeowners and city officials make the development of high density apartment complexes extremely difficult in cities like San Francisco and Berkeley. Currently, there is a movement of young professionals in San Francisco advocating for the abolishment of strict zoning laws and the many bureaucratic obstacles that prevent developers from building and adding supply to the housing market. The slogan of the movement is “YIMBY”—"yes in my backyard!”—as this group of “millennials” is demanding that developers be encouraged to build in order to flood the housing market and thus ultimately reduce rent prices. Through local, bottom-up politics, the YIMBY movement has begun to make progress and has partnered with labor and environmental groups (<a href="https://www.grist.org/article/san-francisco-environmentalists-housing-development-fight/">grist.org/article/san-francisco-environmentalists-housing-development-fight/</a>). 
          </p>
          <p>
            As the housing crisis pertains to Berkeley students, due to high (and rising) rent prices and lack of enough subsidized housing for financial aid students, lower income students are often forced to face temporary homelessness, live in substandard housing units, or to live outside of Berkeley and have long commutes just to get to campus and back. Clearly, this creates an inequitable distribution of the crucial student necessity of simply living near the university. The purpose of this website is to (1) give a clear visualization of the housing crisis in Berkeley and how it has worsened over time, (2) discuss what needs to be done to address the problem as well as the actions currently being taken by students and the University towards a solution to this problem, and most importantly to (3) raise awareness of the extent to which this issue affects the academic experiences of thousands of undergraduates, graduate students, and post docs who attend or work for UC Berkeley.
          </p>
          <h4>Why is this an E.J. issue?</h4>
          <p>
            Proponents of environmental justice consider people’s living conditions, neighborhoods, and immediate surroundings to be crucial aspects of “the environment” by definition. It has been shown by many studies that low income people and people of color bear greater health risks from environmental hazards, including a greater risk of lead poisoning from substandard housing establishments, asthma from air pollution, and of cancer from chemical releases by nearby locally unwanted land uses (LULUs), to name a few (Paulose, 524; Mohai et al., 406). I claim, in the spirit of having a holistic definition of what we call “the environment,” that the housing crisis in Berkeley is indeed an environmental justice issue. For one, it by definition affects low income students the most. Furthermore, having a contingency of students, graduate students, and post docs that have a long daily commute to campus not only negatively affects their own ability to focus on their academic work, but it contributes greatly to the carbon footprint of the university and in this way contributes to Berkeley’s unsustainability as an institution. In fact, what is happening in Berkeley is a microcosm of what is going on in metropolitan areas all around California—rents in cities are so high that people who work in the city, including white collar workers and tech professionals, are continually moving outwards into suburbs from which they drive to their jobs on a daily basis, contributing to an inefficient and unsustainable use of city infrastructure as well a very large carbon footprint.
          </p>
          <h4>Why should UC Berkeley care?</h4>
          <p>
            If the purpose of the university is to construct an environment for the attainment of higher knowledge and truth, then by definition university has a responsibility to ensure that the basic living needs the admitted students can be met. Undergraduates dealing with the slew of incessant issues that come with housing insecurity are worse able to even focus on their classes and their jobs, let alone spend time participating in the clubs and organizations that really make Berkeley flourish. At Berkeley, graduate students and undergraduate TAs essentially run all of the courses for undergraduates at Berkeley, as well as contributing to research work that contributes to the prestige of the professors and the university itself, so having a large contingency of housing insecure graduate students is bad in many ways for the university. Post docs also teach, run classes on their own, and contribute important research to the university, all for extremely low pay, and so again it hurts the university if post docs cannot afford to live in Berkeley.

          <h4>Mapping out rent prices in Berkeley</h4>
          <p>
            Below is an interactive map that displays the demographics and some rent statistics for each census tract in Alameda county (when it first loads it will be centered on UC Berkeley). This map illustrates why some students move so far away from campus just to find affordable places to live. As you mouse over the map, a popup will appear with the demographics of the census tract that the mouse is currently hovering over. If you mouse over one of the targets (which are located at the centroid of each census tract) a popup will display the median rent price for a unit in that census tract, as well as the distribution of prices of units that lie in different price ranges.
