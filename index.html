          <h4>Context and Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Every student knows how hard it is to find housing in Berkeley. More generally, anyone living or working in the Bay Area knows how rents are, in general, extremely expensive. The housing crisis is not new to the Bay Area—in fact it has existed since the 1970s, and has only worsened since then. A lack of space, strict zoning laws, and staunch opposition from neighborhood homeowners and city officials make the development of high density apartment complexes extremely difficult in cities like San Francisco and Berkeley. Currently, there is a movement of young professionals in San Francisco advocating for the abolishment of strict zoning laws and the many bureaucratic obstacles that prevent developers from building and adding supply to the housing market. The slogan of the movement is “YIMBY”—"yes in my backyard!”—as this group of “millennials” is demanding that developers be encouraged to build in order to flood the housing market and thus ultimately reduce rent prices. Through local, bottom-up politics, the YIMBY movement has begun to make progress and has partnered with labor and environmental groups (<a href="https://www.grist.org/article/san-francisco-environmentalists-housing-development-fight/">grist.org/article/san-francisco-environmentalists-housing-development-fight/</a>).

            The purpose of this website is to (1) give a clear visualization of the housing crisis in Berkeley and how it has worsened over time, (2) discuss what needs to be done to address the problem as well as the actions currently being taken by students and the University towards a solution to this problem, and most importantly to (3) raise awareness of the extent to which this issue affects the academic experiences of thousands of undergraduates, graduate students, and post docs who attend or work for UC Berkeley.

          <h4>Why should UC Berkeley care?</h4>
          <p>
            If the purpose of the university is to be a place for the attainment of higher knowledge and truth, then by definition university has a responsibility to ensure that the basic needs the admitted students can be met. Undergraduates dealing with the slew of incessant issues that come with housing insecurity are worse able to even focus on their classes and their jobs, let alone spend time participating in the clubs and organizations that really make Berkeley flourish. Like an any large research university, graduate students and, at least in the math and computer science departments, undergraduate TAs essentially run all of the courses for undergraduates at Berkeley, as well as contributing to research work that contributes to the prestige of the professors and the university itself, so having a large contingency of housing insecure graduate students is bad in many ways for the university. Post docs also teach, run classes on their own, and contribute important research to the university, all for extremely low pay, and so again it hurts the university if post docs cannot afford to live in Berkeley.

            Those images give a great intuitive feel for the rise in rents over the past few decades in Berkeley. Now, lets take a closer look at the maps in those images.
